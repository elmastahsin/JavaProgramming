/*
*   2. Create a class calledEmailTask1.
       Assume that email address is constructed by person's first name and followed by an underscore and last name.

        Write a program that can swap first name with last name in the email (Saperated by an underscore).
        If the email doesn't contain an underscore print the given input email.

            Ex:
                input: mike_tyson@gmail.com
                output: tyson_mike@gmail.com*/
